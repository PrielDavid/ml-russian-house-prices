### Where are the full datasets?

The original `train.csv` and `test.csv` (~300Â MB each) are available on Kaggle  
ðŸ‘‰  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sberbank-russian-housing-market/data

**How to reproduce**  
1. Download both CSV files.  
2. Place them under `data/` so the notebooks/scripts can find them.  
3. Run `notebooks/01_EDA.ipynb` or `src/train.py`.

This repo only stores a small sample (`sample_train.csv`, see below) for quick demos.
